# Project: Analysis of Causes of Death in the Top 5 Most Populated Countries

## Introduction
This project explores the causes of death in the five most populated countries: China, India, the United States, Indonesia, and Pakistan. The analysis uses a comprehensive dataset spanning 30 years to uncover patterns, trends, and significant factors contributing to mortality rates in these nations.

## Objectives
- **Analyze and visualize** the total number of deaths over three decades in each country.
- **Identify** the top causes of death for each country and observe how these trends change over time.
- **Provide insights** that could inform policymakers and healthcare professionals in addressing critical public health concerns.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/cause-of-deaths-around-the-world), a well-known platform for data science and analytics competitions. The data includes information on various causes of death across multiple countries over 30 years, providing a solid foundation for in-depth analysis and visualization.
